          <h2 class='title'>HIGHSCHOOL</h2>
          <p class='description'> Start of Highschool I had a hard time making friends and I had to get introduced to
            most people. 9th grade was pretty normal and I didn't dispise school. I did some interships like Cambio Labs
            and All star code. 10th grade was the most fun I ever had in a year. I was taking all Honors and AP courses
            but the program I applied to at the start of the year at columbia wanted me to come on saturdays. The
            problem was trimester 2 and trimester 3 when I had school I had to go in for test prep. I started working in
            office of emergency management in Mount Vernon. I applied for careerwise to only three positions
            orginally.some people told me that I wasn't get into any so I applied for like 10 more. My first choice at
            JPMC accepted me though. Did so well in Algebra II I got selected to be in APCALCULUS in the 11th grade.
            Speaking of the 11th grade I felt like I had to mature quickly I was working my first proffesional job in a
            corporate setting. I Had to study alot on my own because I wasn't in school half the time since I was
            working =. </p>

          <p class='description'>
            Overall I hated my experience with this school. I forgot specifically what people said to me but I never
            forgot how I felt. I asked my mom if I could leave and she told me to write a essay on why. I wrote the
            essay she lost it then told me that other schools are terrible and that I should stay in that one.we used to
            have late room and if our parents or guardians were late to pick us up all the kids would sit inside a room.
            We couldn't talk so I'm not sure what they wanted us to do. I remember the first time I went there when I
            was 5. I started to talk because no one said otherwise. Some teacher added my name down to a list of
            detention and I started crying. The School president at that time erased my name from the list and that was
            one of the few acts of kindness I experinced at that school.  It wasn't that bad though I had a best friend even if he didn't consider me
            one. His family took me to movies like batman Vs superman and introduced me to playstation which I'm
            grateful for because we didn't have any consoles at my house. He moved away though

          <h2 class='title'>MIDDLE SCHOOL</h2>
          <p class='description'>  I remember staying home alot because I didn't feel confortable at school. My friends
            introduced me to fortnite but I could only play on my nintendo switch because that's all I had at the time.
            The year after I saved up my christmas money and my birthday money so I could get a playstation 4. Met my
            current best friend even though we don't talk anymore. Brought Xenoblade 2 which changed my life. The Saving
            grace from my time in Elementary school was the 2020 pandemic. I was in a program though called dream which
            was trying to help prepare kids for the SHSAT. The program got cancelled as soon as the pademic hit. I was
            left to my own devices during that time and I honestly had no motivation to self study for the SHSAT. I
            never knew why I wanted to go to a specialized school but now looking back I guess it was because all my
            friends were going. Their families all had private tutors to help them while I had no one but myself. I took
            the SHSAT, and I was a few hundrend points from getting into any specialized schools. looking back I'm glad
            things worked out the way that they did because I applied to comp sci High.</p>
